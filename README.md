In order to run this code, clone this repository in your local computer and make sure that you have have python, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib and transformers pip installed. I have included code right under the "Word Embeddings" header to support running this file on datahub. It allows transformers to be added to the users's site packages. If transformers is already present, you can comment out the code.
